## Why is git important for scientists?

Git facilitates (1) **documentation**, and (2) **sharing/collaborating**. Both of these are important in science.

* **I. Version-control for code = the lab notebook of experiments. We need documentation for all our processes:**
  + Scenario A: Things were working, now they are not!
  + Scenario B: Why were changes made? 
  + Scenario C: We made changes a long time agoâ€¦
  
* **II. Git and Remote Hosts (e.g., GitHub) makes sharing/collaborating easier**
  + Sharing code made easy
  + Facilitates new collaboration
  + Encourages open source and open science
