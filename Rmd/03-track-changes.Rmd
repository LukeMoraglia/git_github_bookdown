# Tracking Changes (`git add & commit`)

The key commands for documenting changes are `git add` and `git commit`.

**Key terms/commands:** 

* **git add**: Tells git which file's changes you want to document. Formally, this is called adding a file to the "index/staging area".

* **git commit**: Tell git to document the changes you specified using `git add` (i.e., the files in the staging area), with an accompanying **commit message** that you **have to provide** to explain what changes were made. 

While the process of adding and then committing seems redundant, overtime it will be apparent why we don't always just commit ALL changes that have been made to your files, and how the 'mandatory' commit message creates a good documentation for your project.

## Adding new files/modification (`git add`)

Make sure you are in the correct directory

```{bash}
cd ~/workdir
```

```{r echo=F}
# Change directory into workdir so the rest of the bash commands will be run in it
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="~/workdir")
```

Make a new file `foo.txt`

```{bash}
touch foo.txt
```

Check the status
```{bash}
git status
```


If there are **untracked files**, we would like to add those files so git will track their changes:

```{bash}
git add foo.txt
```

Check the status again, `foo.txt` should now be ready to get committed (a commit is a revision to your files).

```{bash}
git status
```

## Saving these changes to the repository (`git commit`)

Commit the file and note the identifier for this commit (e.g., `f22b25e`):

```{bash}
git commit -m "Add foo.txt to repo"
```


What have we done so far? Lets check the log, which list all the commits made so far. 

```{bash}
git log
```


## BONUS - Checking what has changed before add/commit (`git diff`) {-}
Add some text to the file `foo.txt`

```{bash}
echo hello >> foo.txt
```

Check what has changed between your last commit and now:

```{bash}
git diff
```

Add & commit your changes to `foo.txt`

```{bash}
git add foo.txt
git commit -m "Add hello in foo.txt"
```

Check the status and log again using `git status` and `git log`

##  Notes {-}

* Git does not track an empty directory, so until a directory has a file in it, git would not track it. 

***
You have now used Git to track the file `foo.txt`. You can use `git log` to read what you have done so far in this repository!
