# Tracking Changes (`git add & commit`)

The key commands for documenting changes are `git add` and `git commit`.

**Key terms/commands:** 

* **git add**: Tells git which files' changes you want to document. Formally, this is call adding a file to the "index/staging area".

* **git commit**: Tell git to document the changes you specified using `git add` (i.e., the files in the staging area), with an accompanying **commit message** that you **have to provide** to explain what changes were made. 

While the process of adding and then committing seems redundant, overtime it will be apparent why we don't always just commit ALL changes that have been made to your files, and how the 'mandatory' commit message creates a good documentation for your project.

## Adding new files/modification (`git add`)

Make sure you are in the correct directory

> cd ~/Desktop/workdir

Make a new file `foo.txt`

> touch foo.txt

Check the status

> git status

```{.html}
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	foo.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

If there are **untracked files**, we would like to add those files so git will track their changes:

> git add foo.txt

Check the status again, `foo.txt` should now be ready to get committed (a commit is a revision to your files).

> git status

```
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   foo.txt
```

## Saving these changes to the repository (`git commit`)

Commit the file and note the identifier for this commit (e.g., `f22b25e`):

> git commit -m "Add foo.txt to repo"

```
[master (root-commit) 4fb0bed] Add foo.txt to repo
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 foo.txt
```

What have we done so far? Lets check the log, which list all the commits made so far. 

> git log

```
commit 4fb0bed52e6ab134d72715159857f36ec799863d (HEAD -> master)
Author: Your Name <something@email.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 10 19:19:00 2019 -0500

    Add foo.txt to repo
```

## BONUS - Checking what has changed before add/commit (`git diff`) {-}
Add some text to the file `foo.txt`

> echo hello >> foo.txt

Check what has changed between your last commit and now:

> git diff

```
diff --git a/foo.txt b/foo.txt
index e69de29..ce01362 100644
--- a/foo.txt
+++ b/foo.txt
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+hello
```

Add & commit your changes to `foo.txt`

> git add foo.txt

> git commit -m "Add hello in foo.txt"

Check the status and log again using `git status` and `git log`

##  Notes {-}

* Git does not track an empty directory, so until a directory has a file in it, git would not track it. 

---
You have now used Git to track the file `foo.txt`. You can use `git log` to read what you have done so far in this repository!
