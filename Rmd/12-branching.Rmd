# Branching (`git branch`)

<br>

```{bash, include = F}
# ensure master is the active branch
git checkout master
```

```{bash, include = F}
# ensure that cool_new_function.sh does not exist
if [ -f cool_new_function.sh ]; then
  rm cool_new_function.sh
fi
```

Want to create or edit a new script or function but not ready to make it live (available to everyone) just yet? 

Create a new branch!

## Check what branch you're on

If you've never changed a branch. You're likely using the `master` or main branch.

It's always a good idea to check what branch you're using:

```{r echo=F}
# Change directory into workdir so the rest of the bash commands will be run in it
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="~/workdir")
```

```{bash}
git branch
```

The one marked with the `*` is the name of branch that you're currently on, also known as the active branch.

<br>

## Create new branch

To create a new branch, we can enter:
`git branch <branch_name>`

For example, if we want to make a test a new function on a new branch, we can create the new branch by entering:
```{bash}
git branch cool_new_function
```

To make sure the branch exists, we can enter:
```{bash}
git branch
```

<br>

## Switch between branches (`git commit`)

To switch to the new branch, `git checkout <branch_name>`

Example:
```{bash}
git checkout cool_new_function
````

Let's check that we actually switched.
```{bash}
git branch
```

Notice that the * is now on cool_new_function.

Note: You can also create and switch to a branch in one command using:
`git checkout -b <branch_name>`

Now that you're in your new branch, you can make, edit, and commit script(s) as you want without affecting anything on the master branch.

```{bash}
touch cool_new_function.sh
git add cool_new_function.sh
git commit -m "added cool new function"
ls
```

<br>

## Merge branch

Ready to make the modification available to everyone? Let's merge the change back to the master branch.

First, we have to switch back to the master branch `git checkout master` and then merge the commit `git merge <branch_name>`

```{bash}
git checkout master
ls
```

Notice that there is no cool_new_function.sh file in the master branch.

```{bash}
git merge cool_new_function
ls
```

The cool_new_function.sh file is now available on the master branch after merging.

<br>

## Delete a branch

Done using a branch or created one by accident?

Delete the branch by entering:
`git branch -d <branch_name>`

```{bash}
git branch -d cool_new_function
```

```{bash}
git branch
```
