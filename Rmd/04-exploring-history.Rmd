# Exploring History (`git diff & show`)

```{r echo=F}
# Change directory into workdir so the rest of the bash commands will be run in it
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="~/workdir")
```
## Difference between current file and N commit ago (`git diff HEAD`)

Lets add another line to `foo.txt`

```{bash}
echo world >> foo.txt
```

Check what is different from your current version of foo.txt compare to the last commit

```{bash}
git diff HEAD foo.txt
```

Check difference compare to two commits ago

```{bash}
git diff HEAD~1 foo.txt
```

Check difference against a specific commit based on its identifer (the unique identifier is different for you, use `git log` to check!)

`git diff <unique identifier> foo.txt`

## What was done in ____ commit? (`git show`)

Sometimes we want to check what was done during a certain commit (instead of comparing differences)

```{bash}
git show HEAD~1 foo.txt
```

***
**You have now compared different versions of a file using `git diff` and check its changes during a specific commit using `git show`.**
