# Setting up git
## Download git

* Mac Users: https://git-scm.com/downloads
* Windows User: https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.23.0.windows.1
* Linux User: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Notes for Windows users. The above download will install `Git` and `Git Bash`. [Git Bash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash) gives you a linux-like terminal that runs Bash. Git can also be run from Power Shell, but Git Bash would allow you to run every command in this tutorial (e.g., functions such as `touch` or `echo` for making file and printing lines in a terminal). 
	
## Configuring git 
This user name and email is your identity when using git. Sometimes you don't want to use a personal email, a no-reply email associated with Github is available for that. For now, just use your personal email.

### Setup username and email
> git config --global user.name "Your Name"

> git config --global user.email "Your Email"


### Setup the correct linebreaks encoding
Differnt operating systems (OS) uses different characters to encode new lines (linebreaks). Setting git to make sure it reads the correct type of characters as linebreaks.

**Mac/Linux**

> git config --global core.autocrlf input

**Windows**

> git config --global core.autocrlf true

### Setup "nano" as the text editor to interface with git
The default text editor for git is [Vim](https://eastmanreference.com/a-quick-start-guide-for-beginners-to-the-vim-text-editor), which is difficult to use. [nano](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/) is a good alternative that can still handle text editing within the terminal. (You could setup other text editors as your default).

> git config --global core.editor "nano -w"

### Check to ensure settings are correct
> git config --list
