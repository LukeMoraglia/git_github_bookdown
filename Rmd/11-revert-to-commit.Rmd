# Revert to a previous commit (`git checkout`)

**Key terms/commands:**

* **git checkout**: A git command to revert a file to a previous state. You can also checkout your entire folder, but that is potentially a dangerous move (read the end of this chapter).

## Going back to a specific version of a file (`git checkout`)

Make sure you are in your original `workdir`
```{bash}
cd ~/workdir
ls
```

```{r echo=F}
# Change directory into workdir so the rest of the bash commands will be run in it
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="~/workdir")
```

Make some changes to `foo.txt`

```{bash}
echo "A whole new world" >> foo.txt
```


Let assume we want to go back to a previous version of foo.txt.

Before going back to a previous state of a file, COMMIT what you have now

```{bash}
git add foo.txt

git commit -m "Add 'A whole new world' to foo.txt"
```

Recover the `foo.txt` that doesn't have "A whole new world" in it (use HEAD~1 or unique identifier)

```{bash}
git checkout HEAD~1 foo.txt
```

Check what is in `foo.txt`

```{bash}
cat foo.txt
```

Go back to the state where "A whole new world" is in the file

```{bash}
git checkout HEAD foo.txt

cat foo.txt
```

## Going back to an entire commit - Detached HEAD (CAUTION)

If you `git checkout` a previous commit without also specifying a file, you will revert the entire directory to a previous condition

```{bash}
git checkout HEAD~1 
```

You should see a warning message about being in a **'detached HEAD'**.

Use `git checkout HEAD` to return to most recent state. IF you checkout a previous commit without first committing your current state, then anything not committed would be lost!!!


## Notes {-}
A [detached HEAD](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/detached-head-when-checkout-commit) means you are not in a branch, and any changes you make will disappear when you switch back to a real branch (e.g., `git checkout master`). More about branching and how to prevent your works from disappearing in the next chapter!

**You have now used `checkout` to look at the past version of a file!**
