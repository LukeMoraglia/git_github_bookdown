* **git init**: A git command that creates a repository (the `.git/` folder).


## Create a directory call `workdir` in your home directory for this tutorial

```{bash}
mkdir ~/workdir
cd ~/workdir	
```

```{r echo=F}
# Change directory into workdir so the rest of the bash commands will be run in it
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="~/workdir")
```


## Create a repository, where git store versions of your file

Create a repository within a folder

```{bash}
git init
```

Check that a hidden folder `.git` has been created

```{bash}
ls -a
```

Check the status of git

```{bash}
git status

You now have a repository (i.e., a `.git/` folder) within a directory that you want to track!
