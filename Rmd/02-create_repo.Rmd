# Creating a Repository (`git init`)

**Key tersm/command**

* **Repository (repo)**: A repo is a `.git/` folder that lives inside the directory that you want to track all the changes you made to it. 
* **git init**: A git command that creates a repository (the `.git/` folder).


## Create a directory call `workdir` in your Desktop for this tutorial

> mkdir ~/Desktop/workdir

> cd ~/Desktop/workdir	


## Create a repository, where git store versions of your file

Create a repository within a folder

> git init

This is what you will see: 
```
Initialized empty Git repository in ~Desktop/workdir/.git/
```

Check that a hidden folder `.git` has been created

> ls -a 

Check the status of git

> git status

```
On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

***
You now have a repository (i.e., a `.git/` folder) within a directory that you want to track!
