# Putting codes on Github

**Key terms/commands:**

**git push**: a commmand to upload your code to a remote repository (like Github!)

## Push an existing repository from your local computer
Go back to the loacl directory, workdir that we made in previous sections. 

```{r echo=F}
# Change directory into workdir so the rest of the bash commands will be run in it
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="~/workdir")
```

```{bash}
cd ~/workdir
```

Add the github repo you just made as a remote repository that you want to push your data to.

* **Replace** your_username with your github username

```{bash}
git remote add origin https://github.com/your_username/workdir.git
```

Check what is listed as your remote repository now. 
```{bash}
git remote -v
```

Push your local repository to your Github

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git push â€“u origin master
```
