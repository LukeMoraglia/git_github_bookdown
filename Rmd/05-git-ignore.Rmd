# Tell git to ignore files
Make a file named `.gitignore` (you can also use nano/any-text-editor to do it)

```{r echo=F}
# Change directory into workdir so the rest of the bash commands will be run in it
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="~/workdir")
```

Make a file that we would want `git` to ignore
```{bash}
touch ignore_this.txt
```

Add this file to `.gitignore`
```{bash}
echo ignore_this.txt >> .gitignore
```

Try `git add` a file we told `.gitignore` to not track

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git add ignore_this.txt
```

```
## The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
## ignore_this.txt
## Use -f if you really want to add them.
```

If you want to `add` a supposedly ignored file, use the `-f` flag

```{bash}
git add -f ignore_this.txt

# Then commit it too!
git commit -m "Add ignore_this.txt"
```

## BONUS - Use wildcard
You can use wildcard expressions in this file as well. Some common things in a `.gitignore` file are `.*`, `*~`, `~*`, which are often temporary or backup files.

***
**There should now be a `.gitignore` file in your directory.**
