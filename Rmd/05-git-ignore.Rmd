# Tell git to ignore files
Make a file named `.gitignore` (you can also use nano/any-text-editor to do it)

> touch ignore_this.txt

> echo ignore_this.txt >> .gitignore

Try `git add ignore_this.txt`, and you will see git will not add it. 
```
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
ignore_this.txt
Use -f if you really want to add them.
```

If you want to `add` a suppsoedly ignored file, use `-f`

> git add -f ignore_this.txt

## BONUS - Use wildcard
You can use wildcard expressions in this file as well. Some common things in a `.gitignore` file are `.*`, `*~`, `~*`, which are often temporary or backup files.

***
**There should now be a `.gitignore` file in your directory.**
