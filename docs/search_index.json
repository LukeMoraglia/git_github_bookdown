Acknowledgment Other helpful links", " Git/GitHub Tutorial for Scientists: its not only for programmers Micaela Chan Preface What is this Git/GitHub Tutorial about? The goal of this tutorial is to help scientists with no formal programming background to (1) start using git locally for version-control of your code, and (2) begin using GitHub to share your code and collaborate with others. Note: If we try to wait until we have perfect codes to share, more likely than not, we will end up never sharing them. Why is git important for scientists? Git faciliates (1) documentation, and (2) faciliates sharing/collaborating. Both of these are important parts in the scientific process. I. Version-control of scripts is the lab notebook of experiments, but for codes In scientific experiments, we are trained to record every parameter that we modified and tested, as it is crucial for both consistency within the experiment and facilitating reproducible results. While we often record the experimental part of our experiments meticulously, the preprocessing and analyzing of data are often ‘assumed’ to be recorded in our scripts. Here are a few scenarios where we wish a detailed history of how codes were developed is available: Scenario A: Things were working, now they are not! You have 5 people collaborating on a single script. That script now results in an error after someone changed a few lines over the weekend. They have no recollection what was changed. ¯\\_(._.)_/¯ Scenario B: Why were changes made? You joined a new lab, and were given a pipeline/script to modify that dated years back. The script is named cool_script_version25000.sh, with few comments. Whoever made it has quit academia and is traveling the world, soul searching, and won’t answer emails. ¯\\_(._.)_/¯ Scenario C: We made changes a long time ago… Collaborator BigName wants to know what preprocessing parameters were used in your manuscript from 5 years ago. You have since changed multiple parameters in your default processing pipeline. ¯\\_(._.)_/¯ Saving something as Final.doc is bad…but Final_script.R is just as bad II. Git and Remote Hosts (e.g., GitHub) makes sharing/collaborating easier Share codes The traditional method of sharing scientific results, manuscripts, is a difficult form to share scripts. For example, while you can share the general processes of how things are done, but the actual 1000+ lines scripts are usually not printed. Remote Hosts such as GitHub (or other alternatives) makes sharing your codes very easy. It’s a link. People can choose to follow your code, and if you update it, they get a notification. Facilitates new collaboration If you found a way to speed up some toolbox, Git/GitHub helps you to suggest this change to the author of the toolbox, even if you don’t know each other. Encourages open source and open science Open source is typically a term used in software development, where it means the source code are open to the public. People can freely look at how a program was written, make improvements with them, etc. In science, the idea of open source is closely linked with open science, a movement to make data, samples, software and all things related to a scientific finding as transparent and easy to access as possible. There are pros and cons to an open and closed system, and the balance between convenience, security, quality control is not a topic that can be adequately covered here. However, given a common goal of of wanting more people to understand, reproduce, and build on top of previous work, an ‘open’ approach to your code is certainly a good place to start. Git/Github will help facilitate your code being shared publicly, allowing you to easily contribute to other projects (and others to contribute to your projects).

The above download will install Git and Git Bash. Git Bash gives you a linux-like terminal that runs Bash. Git can also be run from Power Shell, but Git Bash would allow you to run every command in this tutorial (e.g., functions such as touch or echo for making file and printing lines in a terminal). 1.2 Configuring git This user name and email is your identity when using git. Sometimes you don’t want to use a personal email, a no-reply email associated with Github is available for that. For now, just use your personal email. 1.2.1 Setup username and email git config –global user.name “Your Name” git config –global user.email “Your Email” 1.2.2 Setup the correct linebreaks encoding Differnt operating systems (OS) uses different characters to encode new lines (linebreaks). Setting git to make sure it reads the correct type of characters as linebreaks. Mac/Linux git config –global core.autocrlf input Windows git config –global core.autocrlf true 1.2.3 Setup “nano” as the text editor to interface with git The default text editor for git is Vim, which is difficult to use. nano is a good alternative that can still handle text editing within the terminal. (You could setup other text editors as your default). git config –global core.editor “nano -w” 1.2.4 Check to ensure settings are correct git config –list 1.2.4.1 Helpful links to setting up git https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings#platform-all "],

Key terms/commands: git add: Tells git which files’ changes you want to document. Formally, this is call adding a file to the “index/staging area”. git commit: Tell git to document the changes you specified using git add (i.e., the files in the staging area), with an accompanying commit message that you have to provide to explain what changes were made. While the process of adding and then committing seems redundant, overtime it will be apparent why we don’t always just commit ALL changes that have been made to your files, and how the ‘mandatory’ commit message creates a good documentation for your project. 3.1 Adding new files/modification (git add) Make sure you are in the correct directory cd ~/Desktop/workdir Make a new file foo.txt touch foo.txt Check the status git status On branch master No commits yet Untracked files: (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed) foo.txt nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track) If there are untracked files, we would like to add those files so git will track their changes: git add foo.txt Check the status again, foo.txt should now be ready to get committed (a commit is a revision to your files). git status On branch master No commits yet Changes to be committed: (use &quot;git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage) new file: foo.txt 3.2 Saving these changes to the repository (git commit) Commit the file and note the identifier for this commit (e.g., f22b25e): git commit -m “Add foo.txt to repo” [master (root-commit) 4fb0bed] Add foo.txt to repo 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-) create mode 100644 foo.txt What have we done so far?

You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout. If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example: git checkout -b &lt;new-branch-name&gt; Use git checkout HEAD to return to most recent state.
